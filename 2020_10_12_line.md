#### Line

I noticed I was waking up earlier each day. Just a bit earlier. Tuesday than Monday. Wednesday than Tuesday.

Up to that point I wasn't paying too much attention. It could have been easily explained. Maybe the past few sweltering nights. Maybe some extra stress dragged from work. Well, even pattern changes that come with age. A few days later I noticed I was going to sleep in a similar manner: each time a bit later.

But at some point it stopped looking inoffensive. I've taken to graphing the falling asleep (annoying contraption using a hand crank and a clock) and waking up times. 23:44 to 5:59. 23:45 to 5:58. 23:47 to 5:57. Two minutes and a few seconds less per night, something like that. Despite the slight imprecision when journaling these, the trend was clear. It began to feel more and more relentless. 

Like a line drawn by a pencil, erased from both ends until it shrinks to a dot. And well beyond that.
